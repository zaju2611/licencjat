# GEODRAW

The GeoDraw application is designed to assist elementary school children in learning geometry. It involves solving tasks by drawing or completing missing elements. To successfully solve these tasks, a knowledge of formulas related to various geometric shapes, both in the realm of plane and spatial figures, is required.

The application offers four modes:

- Flat shapes,
- Spatial shapes,
- Flat and spatial shapes,
- Teacher mode

In the first three modes, the user is shown correct solutions to tasks upon clicking the "Check" button. In teacher mode, solutions are saved to a file, which the user can then send to their teacher for evaluation.

To use the application, creating an account and logging in are required. This allows users to access the different modes and check their best results.
